#+TITLE: Movements


* Collision checks
To perform less searches for collision checks while executing movement commands
different strategies could be used depending on movement and cursor directions.

** Move right

*** Selection direction: backward
Selections won't collide until cursor boundary is crossed, however for movement
on more columns than distance for the boundary it's required to run checks.
